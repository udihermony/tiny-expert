    "Step 1: Find a stone with a slight hourglass shape that can be lashed securely.",
    "Step 2: If no suitable stone is found, create grooves by repeatedly rapping it with a smaller hard stone (pecking technique).",
    "Step 3: Select a straight-grained hardwood handle of comfortable length relative to the stone's weight.",
    "Step 4: Lash the stone to the handle using one of three methods: split handle, forked branch, or wrapped handle.",
    "Step 5: Test the balance and ensure the stone is securely attached before use."

  "warnings": [
    "Ensure the stone is properly secured - a loose stone can become a projectile.",
    "Match handle length to stone weight to prevent the club from being unwieldy.",
    "Test all lashings before relying on the weapon."
