  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find high ground or climb a tree to get good view of river or stream.",
    "Step 2: Look for level stretches where river breaks into 2-3 narrow channels instead of one wide channel.",
    "Step 3: Identify shallow banks or sandbars for easier crossing.",
    "Step 4: Select crossing point upstream from sandbar so current carries you to it if you lose footing.",
    "Step 5: Choose route that crosses current at 45-degree angle downstream.",
    "Step 6: Avoid rock ledges crossing river (indicates dangerous rapids or canyons).",
    "Step 7: Avoid areas directly above waterfalls or deep channels.",
    "Step 8: Avoid river estuaries which have strong currents and tides."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Never attempt crossing directly above waterfalls or dangerous rapids.",
    "Avoid rocky areas where submerged rocks create slipping hazards.",
    "Stay away from eddies which can create powerful backward pull and drag you under.",
    "River estuaries can have tidal influences extending many kilometers upstream."
