  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Hold the watch horizontal and point the hour hand directly at the sun.",
    "Step 2: Find the angle between the hour hand and the 12 o'clock mark.",
    "Step 3: Bisect this angle (find the midpoint) to get the north-south line.",
    "Step 4: Remember the sun is in the east before noon and west after noon to identify which end is north.",
    "Step 5: If on daylight savings time, use the midpoint between hour hand and 1 o'clock instead."

  "warnings": [
    "Accuracy decreases closer to the equator.",
    "Must use true local time, not daylight savings time for best accuracy.",
    "Only works with analog watches - draw a clock face if you only have digital."
