  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select three straight sticks and carve precise notches to hold them in figure-4 pattern under tension.",
    "Step 2: Practice the trigger assembly beforehand - it requires close tolerances and precise angles.",
    "Step 3: Position a heavy weight (rock or log) above the trigger that will kill or incapacitate prey immediately.",
    "Step 4: Set the vertical stick into the ground with notch facing the direction prey will approach from.",
    "Step 5: Balance the horizontal stick in the vertical stick's notch, supporting the diagonal stick.",
    "Step 6: Position the diagonal stick to hold the weight, with its notch catching on the horizontal stick.",
    "Step 7: Place bait on or near the horizontal trigger stick."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Weight must be heavy enough to kill immediately - wounded animals may escape.",
    "Requires precise construction and practice to set reliably.",
    "Trigger is sensitive and may go off accidentally during setup."
