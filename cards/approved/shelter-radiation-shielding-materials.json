  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Use the densest materials available - lead, iron, concrete, and water are most effective.",
    "Step 2: Apply the half-value layer principle: each additional layer of the same thickness cuts radiation by half.",
    "Step 3: Use 1 meter of dirt to reduce 1,000 cgys per hour to about 0.5 cgy per hour inside shelter.",
    "Step 4: Stack materials in layers - 5cm of brick reduces radiation by half, 10cm reduces to one-fourth.",
    "Step 5: Prioritize underground shelters with 1+ meters of earth coverage.",
    "Step 6: Seek caves, storm cellars, culverts, or basements of stone/mud buildings if available."

  "warnings": [
    "Thin roofing provides very little shielding benefit.",
    "Time spent gathering shielding materials must be weighed against radiation exposure.",
    "The denser the material, the better - but any shielding is better than none."
