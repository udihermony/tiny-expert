  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Build a funnel-shaped barrier extending from both sides of the animal trail toward the trap.",
    "Step 2: Make the narrowest part of the funnel nearest to the trap location.",
    "Step 3: Reduce the trail width to just slightly wider than the target animal's body.",
    "Step 4: Maintain this narrow constriction for at least one animal body length back from the trap.",
    "Step 5: Begin widening toward the mouth of the funnel beyond this point.",
    "Step 6: Make barriers inconspicuous but inconvenient to go over or through - they don't need to be impassable."

  "warnings": [
    "Channelization must look natural or animals will become suspicious.",
    "Wild animals rarely back up - they prefer to continue forward into traps.",
    "Barriers that are too obvious will alert prey and cause avoidance."
