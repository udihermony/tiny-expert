  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Collect several straight sticks of similar length and flexible vines for lashing.",
    "Step 2: Lash sticks together with vines to form a funnel shape with the wide opening for fish entry.",
    "Step 3: Close the narrow top of the funnel, leaving a hole just large enough for target fish to swim through.",
    "Step 4: Ensure the funnel narrows consistently from opening to the small entry hole.",
    "Step 5: For saltwater use: build trap at low tide in location scouted at high tide.",
    "Step 6: On rocky shores, use natural rock pools; on coral reefs, block pool openings as tide recedes.",
    "Step 7: On sandy shores, use sandbars and enclosed ditches with low stone walls angled toward shore."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Entry hole must be sized for target fish - too large allows easy escape, too small prevents entry.",
    "Position traps where fish naturally travel - schools move with tides and along shores.",
    "Check local regulations regarding fish trapping in non-survival situations."
