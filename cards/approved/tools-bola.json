  ],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Create three cords of equal length with weights attached to each end.",
    "Step 2: Tie the three cords together at their center points with a strong knot.",
    "Step 3: To use: hold the bola by the center knot.",
    "Step 4: Twirl it above your head to build momentum.",
    "Step 5: Release the center knot so the bola flies toward your target.",
    "Step 6: The weighted cords will separate and wrap around the target to immobilize it."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Practice in an open area away from people - the weights can cause injury.",
    "Ensure all knots are secure before use to prevent weights from flying loose.",
    "Most effective against flocks of birds or small running animals."
