    "Step 1: Use only as last resort - sealed combat rations and processed food in containers are safer.",
    "Step 2: Select only healthy-looking plants and animals. Avoid known vector carriers like rats.",
    "Step 3: Always wear gloves and protective clothing when handling any local food sources.",
    "Step 4: Prepare plants using same methods as for radioactive areas (wash, peel, scrub).",
    "Step 5: Cook all food by boiling only - boil for at least 10 minutes to kill all pathogens.",
    "Step 6: Never fry, bake, or roast local food - no guarantee all portions reach killing temperature."

  "warnings": [
    "No guarantee that cooking kills all biological agents",
    "Use local food only in life or death situations",
    "You can survive longer without food than you can survive eating contaminated food",
