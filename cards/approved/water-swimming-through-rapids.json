    "Step 1: In fast shallow rapids: Lie on your back with feet pointing downstream.",
    "Step 2: In fast shallow rapids: Use finning motion with hands alongside hips to increase buoyancy and steer.",
    "Step 3: In fast shallow rapids: Keep feet up to avoid catching them on rocks.",
    "Step 4: In deep rapids: Lie on stomach with head pointing downstream.",
    "Step 5: In deep rapids: Angle toward shore whenever possible while maintaining downstream orientation.",
    "Step 6: In all rapids: Never fight the current - swim with it while working toward shore.",
    "Step 7: Watch for obstacles and dangerous backwater eddies and converging currents."

  "warnings": [
    "Never attempt to stand or fight against swift current - this can lead to drowning.",
    "Keep body horizontal to water to reduce risk of being pulled under.",
    "Avoid backwater eddies and converging currents which contain dangerous swirls.",
    "Do not attempt if water temperature is extremely cold - hypothermia risk is fatal."
