  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Reject any animal that appears sick or diseased - it may have bacterial infection from radiation.",
    "Step 2: Carefully skin the animal to prevent radioactive particles on fur from entering the body.",
    "Step 3: Cut meat away from bones, leaving at least 3 millimeters of meat on the bone - discard the bone.",
    "Step 4: Remove and discard all internal organs (heart, liver, kidneys) as they concentrate radiation.",
    "Step 5: Cut meat into pieces less than 13 millimeters thick for thorough cooking.",
    "Step 6: Cook meat until very well done to ensure all portions reach safe temperature."

  "warnings": [
    "Do not eat contaminated meat even if cooked - it can cause severe illness or death",
    "Animal skeletons contain over 90% of radioactivity - never eat meat close to bones",
    "Internal organs concentrate beta and gamma radiation - always discard them"
