  "warnings": [
    "Never do total body rewarming in warm water bath outside hospital - increases risk of cardiac arrest.",
    "Do not force unconscious person to drink fluids.",
    "Rewarming too rapidly can cause circulatory problems and heart failure.",
    "The person helping in sleeping bag can also become hypothermic if left too long."
