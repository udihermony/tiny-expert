    "Step 1: Find a staff or branch that is short enough to swing easily but long enough to damage your target.",
    "Step 2: Ensure the diameter fits comfortably in your palm but isn't so thin it will break on impact.",
    "Step 3: Look for straight-grained hardwood if available for maximum durability.",
    "Step 4: Test the club's weight and balance by swinging it a few times."

  "warnings": [
    "Do not use clubs against armed enemies - they only extend your reach beyond fingertips.",
    "Avoid wood that is too thin as it will break upon impact.",
    "Clubs are for holding and swinging, not throwing."
