  ],
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Make spear from long straight sapling, sharpen end or attach knife/metal point.",
    "Step 2: Alternative: split shaft few inches from end, insert wood spreader, sharpen both halves.",
    "Step 3: Find areas where fish gather or fish runs in waist-deep water with good visibility.",
    "Step 4: Place spear point into water and move slowly toward fish to avoid startling them.",
    "Step 5: Account for light refraction - fish appear higher in water than actual position.",
    "Step 6: With sudden push, impale fish against stream bottom rather than trying to lift with spear.",
    "Step 7: Hold spear with one hand, grab and secure fish with the other hand."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Never throw the spear, especially if point is a knife - you cannot afford to lose it.",
    "Light refraction makes fish appear in different position than reality.",
    "Fish will slip off spear if you try to lift them - always grab with free hand.",
    "Work slowly and patiently to avoid spooking fish in the area."
