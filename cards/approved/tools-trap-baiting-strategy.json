    "Step 1: Choose bait the animal recognizes but cannot easily find nearby (avoid baiting with corn in a corn field).",
    "Step 2: Avoid exotic baits that may make animals curious but cautious of strange food.",
    "Step 3: Use peanut butter from MREs or salt as effective baits for small mammals.",
    "Step 4: Scatter small bits of bait around the trap area to let animals sample and develop craving.",
    "Step 5: If wrong species takes bait without being caught, identify the animal and set appropriate trap for that species using same bait.",
    "Step 6: Use successful catches to bait multiple additional traps."

  "warnings": [
    "Bait that's too readily available nearby will not attract animals to traps.",
    "Unknown or exotic baits may increase animal wariness rather than attraction.",
    "Successfully trapped animals provide excellent bait for additional traps."
