  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Stay downwind from seal at all times during approach.",
    "Step 2: Move closer cautiously while seal sleeps - they raise heads every 30 seconds to watch for polar bears.",
    "Step 3: When seal moves, stop and imitate by lying flat on ice, raising head up and down, wriggling body slightly.",
    "Step 4: Approach with body sideways and arms close to body to look like another seal.",
    "Step 5: Get within 22-45 meters and kill instantly with brain shot.",
    "Step 6: Reach seal quickly before it slides into water on smooth, inclined ice."

  "warnings": [
    "Seals are found near polar bears - bears have stalked and killed seal hunters.",
    "Ice at breathing holes is usually smooth and inclined - seal may slide into water easily.",
    "In winter, dead seals usually float but are difficult to retrieve from water.",
    "Keep seal blubber and skin from contacting scratches or broken skin - can cause 'spekk-finger' reaction with severe hand swelling."
