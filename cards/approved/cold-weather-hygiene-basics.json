    "Step 1: Take snow baths when washing is impractical - use a handful of snow to wash areas where sweat accumulates (under arms, between legs), then wipe dry immediately.",
    "Step 2: Wash your feet daily if possible and put on clean, dry socks.",
    "Step 3: Change underwear at least twice a week.",
    "Step 4: If unable to wash underwear, remove it, shake it out, and let it air for 1-2 hours.",
    "Step 5: Check your body and clothing for lice each night if using a previously occupied shelter.",
    "Step 6: If you shave, do so before bed to allow skin recovery time before exposure."

  "warnings": [
    "Neglecting hygiene can lead to skin rashes that develop into serious medical problems.",
    "If clothing becomes lice-infested and you have no insecticide, hang clothes in cold air, then beat and brush them - this removes lice but not eggs."
