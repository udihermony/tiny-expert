  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Cut or break several green logs with wrist-sized trunks (trees break easier in extreme cold).",
    "Step 2: Lay the first layer of logs side by side on top of the snow.",
    "Step 3: Add a second layer of logs on top of the first layer.",
    "Step 4: Lay the top layer of logs perpendicular (at right angles) to the layer below.",
    "Step 5: Build your fire on top of this dry log platform."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Use only green (living) logs as they won't burn as quickly and provide a stable platform.",
    "Ensure the platform is large enough that burning materials won't fall through to the snow.",
    "Dead or dry logs will burn and collapse, dropping your fire into the snow."
