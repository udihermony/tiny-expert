    "Step 1: Understand that at 43°C (110°F) doing hard work in sun requires 19 liters of water daily.",
    "Step 2: For temperatures below 38°C (100°F), drink 0.5 liters of water every hour.",
    "Step 3: For temperatures above 38°C (100°F), drink 1 liter of water every hour.",
    "Step 4: Adjust intake based on activity level - more work requires more water.",

    "Step 6: Drink at regular intervals even with limited water supply."
