  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Transmit only in clear, unobstructed terrain - radios are line-of-sight devices.",
    "Step 2: Keep antenna at right angles to rescuing aircraft - no signal comes from antenna tip.",
    "Step 3: Never let antenna touch clothing, body, foliage, or ground - greatly reduces signal range.",
    "Step 4: If radio has tone capability, place upright on flat, elevated surface.",
    "Step 5: Conserve battery - turn off when not using, don't transmit constantly.",
    "Step 6: In cold weather, keep battery inside clothing when not in use.",
    "Step 7: Keep radio and battery dry - water destroys circuitry."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Cold quickly drains battery power.",
    "Extreme heat may cause battery to explode.",
    "In hostile territory, keep transmissions short to avoid enemy direction finding.",
    "Any terrain between radio and receiver blocks the signal."
