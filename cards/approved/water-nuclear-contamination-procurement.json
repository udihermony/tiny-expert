  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Wait at least 48 hours before drinking any water to allow radioactive decay.",
    "Step 2: Prioritize underground sources: springs, wells, or water from pipes in abandoned buildings.",
    "Step 3: Use snow from 15+ centimeters below the surface during fallout.",
    "Step 4: For streams/rivers, dig sediment holes along the side to create natural filtration.",
    "Step 5: For standing water, fill container 3/4 full, add 2.5cm dirt per 10cm water, stir well.",
    "Step 6: Let dirt mixture settle for 6+ hours, then dip out clear water from top.",
    "Step 7: Filter all water through additional filtration device before drinking.",
    "Step 8: Treat with purification tablets or boil as additional precaution."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Standing water from lakes and ponds will be heavily contaminated.",
    "Even 'clean' water sources may contain harmful bacteria.",
    "Seepage basin filtration can remove up to 99% of radioactivity but requires proper covering."
