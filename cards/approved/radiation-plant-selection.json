    "Step 1: First choice - underground vegetables (potatoes, turnips, carrots). Scrub thoroughly and remove all skin.",
    "Step 2: Second choice - fruits/vegetables you can wash and peel (bananas, apples, tomatoes, prickly pears).",
    "Step 3: Third choice - smooth-skinned plants that cannot be peeled. Wash thoroughly (removes 90% contamination).",
    "Step 4: Last resort only - rough-surfaced plants (lettuce, dried fruits). Washing removes only 50% contamination.",
    "Step 5: Avoid growing plants that may have absorbed radioactive materials through leaves and roots."

  "warnings": [
    "Never eat rough-surfaced plants unless facing starvation",
    "Avoid plants that were growing during or after fallout period",
