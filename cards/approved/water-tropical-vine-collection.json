    "Step 1: Look for vines with rough bark and shoots about 5 centimeters thick.",

    "Step 4: Let the liquid drip into your mouth rather than putting mouth directly on vine.",
    "Step 5: Use a container to collect liquid if available.",
    "Step 6: Test small amounts first to check for skin irritation."

  "warnings": [
    "Some vines have poisonous sap that appears as sticky, milky substance.",
