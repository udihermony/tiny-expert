  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Create a ridgepole by making a tripod with two short stakes and one long pole, or anchor one end to a tree at waist height.",
    "Step 2: Prop large sticks along both sides of ridgepole to create wedge-shaped ribbing wide enough for your body.",
    "Step 3: Ensure ribbing is steep enough to shed moisture effectively.",
    "Step 4: Place finer sticks and brush crosswise on the ribbing to create latticework preventing debris from falling through.",
    "Step 5: Add light, dry debris (grass, pine needles, leaves) over ribbing until at least 1 meter thick - thicker is better.",
    "Step 6: Place 30-centimeter layer of insulating material inside the shelter for bedding.",
    "Step 7: Pile insulating material at entrance that can be dragged inside to close the opening.",
    "Step 8: Add shingling material or branches on top to prevent debris from blowing away in storms."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Debris layer must be at least 1 meter thick for adequate insulation.",
    "Ensure ribbing is steep enough or shelter will not shed water properly.",
    "Check overhead for loose branches or dead trees that could fall on shelter."
