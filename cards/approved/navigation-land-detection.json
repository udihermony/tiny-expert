  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Look for fixed cumulus clouds in clear sky - often hover over or downwind from islands.",
    "Step 2: In tropics, watch for greenish tint in sky from sunlight reflecting off shallow lagoons/coral reefs.",
    "Step 3: In arctic, look for light-colored cloud reflections indicating ice fields or snow-covered land.",
    "Step 4: Note water color changes - deep water is dark green/blue, lighter color indicates shallow water near land.",
    "Step 5: Listen for roar of surf, especially at night or in fog.",
    "Step 6: Smell for musty odor of mangrove swamps and mud flats.",
    "Step 7: Watch bird flight patterns - more birds near land, flocks fly toward land at dusk, away at dawn."

  "warnings": [
    "Mirages are common in tropics during midday - they disappear when viewed from different heights.",
    "Bird flight direction during day has no significance as they search for food.",
    "Deep water waves refract as they approach land - travel parallel to turbulent areas to reach shore."
