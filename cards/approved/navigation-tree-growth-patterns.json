  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find several felled trees or stumps for comparison.",
    "Step 2: Examine the tree growth rings on the cut surface.",
    "Step 3: Look for the side where growth rings are more widely spaced - this faces toward the equator.",
    "Step 4: The side with closer-together growth rings faces toward the poles.",
    "Step 5: In Northern Hemisphere: widely spaced rings face south, closely spaced face north.",
    "Step 6: In Southern Hemisphere: widely spaced rings face north, closely spaced face south."

  "warnings": [
    "The old saying about moss indicating north is inaccurate - moss grows all around trees.",
    "Need multiple tree stumps for comparison to be reliable.",
    "Growth patterns can be affected by local conditions like wind, water, or terrain."
