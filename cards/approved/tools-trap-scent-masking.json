  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Use gall bladder fluid and urine from previous kills to coat hands and trap parts (never use human urine).",
    "Step 2: Coat hands and trap with mud from areas with rotting vegetation.",
    "Step 3: Smoke trap parts over a fire - animals associate smoke with natural fires, not human presence.",
    "Step 4: If time permits, let traps weather outdoors for several days before setting (do not handle during weathering).",
    "Step 5: Remove all fresh dirt if you must dig - carry it away from the area completely.",
    "Step 6: Prepare trap parts away from the actual site, then carry them in and assemble quickly."

  "warnings": [
    "Even slight human scent will cause most mammals to avoid the area entirely.",
    "Fresh-cut vegetation 'bleeds' sap that creates alarming odors for animals.",
    "Birds have poor smell but mammals depend on scent more than sight."
