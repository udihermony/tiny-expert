  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find a sunny slope and gather a clear plastic bag, green leafy vegetation, and a small rock.",
    "Step 2: Fill the bag with air by scooping air into it or turning the opening into the breeze.",
    "Step 3: Fill the bag half to three-fourths full with green leafy vegetation, removing all sharp sticks or spines.",
    "Step 4: Place a small rock inside the bag to create a low point.",
    "Step 5: Close and tie the bag mouth securely as close to the end as possible to maximize air space.",
    "Step 6: If available, insert tubing into the mouth before tying, then plug the tube end.",
    "Step 7: Place the bag mouth-downhill on the sunny slope with the mouth slightly higher than the low point.",
    "Step 8: Position so the rock settles into the lowest point of the bag.",
    "Step 9: After 24 hours, collect water by loosening the tie and draining water around the rock."

  "warnings": [
    "Never use poisonous vegetation - it will produce poisonous liquid.",
    "Remove all sharp objects that could puncture the bag.",
    "Change vegetation after extracting most water to ensure continued production."
