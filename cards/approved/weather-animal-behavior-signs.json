  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Observe the flight patterns of birds and insects in your area.",
    "Step 2: Note if they are flying lower to the ground than usual - this indicates heavy, moisture-laden air and likely rain.",
    "Step 3: Watch for increased insect activity, which typically occurs before storms.",
    "Step 4: Exception: Increased bee activity indicates fair weather approaching.",
    "Step 5: Combine these observations with other weather signs for better prediction accuracy."
