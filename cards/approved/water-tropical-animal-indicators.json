  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Look for grazing animals like deer - they drink at dawn and dusk and stay near water.",
    "Step 2: Follow converging game trails which often lead to water sources.",
    "Step 3: Watch grain-eating birds (finches, pigeons) - they fly straight and low toward water at dawn/dusk.",
    "Step 4: Observe bees - they range within 6 kilometers of water sources.",
    "Step 5: Follow ant columns marching up trees to find small water reservoirs.",
    "Step 6: Look for flies, especially European mason flies with iridescent green bodies - they stay within 100 meters of water.",
    "Step 7: Follow human tracks which usually lead to wells or water sources."

  "warnings": [
    "Do not rely on carnivores - they get moisture from prey and can go long periods without water.",
    "Water birds fly long distances - not reliable indicators.",
    "Birds of prey get liquids from victims - cannot be used as water indicators."
