  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Remove tendons from large game such as deer.",
    "Step 2: Dry the tendons completely in sun or near a fire.",
    "Step 3: Smash the dried tendons so they separate into individual fibers.",
    "Step 4: Moisten the fibers slightly to make them workable.",
    "Step 5: Twist the moistened fibers into a continuous strand.",
    "Step 6: For stronger lashing, braid multiple strands together.",
    "Step 7: Use while moist - sinew becomes sticky when wet and hardens when dry."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Ensure tendons are completely dry before processing to prevent rot.",
    "Work quickly once moistened as sinew becomes harder to work as it dries.",
    "No knots needed for small lashings as dried sinew hardens in place."
