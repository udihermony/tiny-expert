  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Ensure you are using true local time without daylight savings adjustments for accuracy.",
    "Step 2: In northern hemisphere: Hold watch horizontal and point hour hand at the sun.",
    "Step 3: In northern hemisphere: Bisect angle between hour hand and 12 o'clock mark to get north-south line.",
    "Step 4: In southern hemisphere: Point 12 o'clock mark toward sun and find midpoint between 12 and hour hand for north-south line.",
    "Step 5: Remember sun rises in east, sets in west, and is due south at noon (northern hemisphere) to identify which end is north."

  "warnings": [
    "If watch is on daylight savings time, use midpoint between hour hand and 1 o'clock instead of 12 o'clock.",
    "Method becomes more accurate the further you are from the equator.",
    "For digital watch users, draw analog watch face on paper with correct time to use this method."
