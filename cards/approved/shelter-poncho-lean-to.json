  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Check wind direction and position the shelter so the back faces into the wind.",
    "Step 2: Tie off the poncho hood by pulling drawstring tight, rolling it lengthwise, folding in thirds, and tying off.",
    "Step 3: Cut rope in half (1-1.5 meters each). Tie each half to corner grommets on one long side of poncho.",
    "Step 4: Attach 10-centimeter drip sticks to each rope, 2.5 centimeters from the grommets to prevent water running down ropes.",
    "Step 5: Tie ropes to trees at waist height using round turn and two half hitches with quick-release knot, 2-3 meters apart.",
    "Step 6: Spread poncho and anchor to ground by pushing sharpened 30-centimeter stakes through grommets.",
    "Step 7: Place insulating material (leaves, pine needles) inside the lean-to to reduce heat loss to ground."

  "warnings": [
    "You lose up to 80% of body heat to the ground when at rest - insulation underneath is critical.",
    "Ensure drip sticks are properly positioned or rainwater will run into your shelter.",
    "Make sure the back of the lean-to faces into the wind direction."
