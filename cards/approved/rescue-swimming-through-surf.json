  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Swim toward shore in the trough (low area) between waves, not on wave crests.",
    "Step 2: When a seaward wave approaches, face it directly and submerge underwater.",
    "Step 3: After the wave passes over you, surface and continue swimming toward shore in the next trough.",
    "Step 4: If caught in undertow, push off the bottom or swim to surface, then proceed shoreward as above.",
    "Step 5: Repeat this pattern of diving under approaching waves and swimming in troughs until you reach shallow water."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Never try to swim over or through breaking waves - they can drive you underwater and cause drowning.",
    "Do not fight against strong undertow - work with the water's movement instead.",
    "Conserve energy by timing your movements with wave patterns rather than fighting them."
