  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Keep clothing CLEAN - dirt and grease reduce insulation by crushing air pockets.",
    "Step 2: Avoid OVERHEATING - adjust clothing to prevent sweating by opening parka, removing layers, or changing headgear.",
    "Step 3: Wear clothes LOOSE and in LAYERS - tight clothing restricts circulation and reduces air insulation.",
    "Step 4: Keep clothing DRY - wear water repellent outer layer and brush off snow before entering shelter.",
    "Step 5: Always keep head covered - you lose 40-45% of body heat through unprotected head.",
    "Step 6: Protect neck, wrists, and ankles which are efficient heat radiators."

  "warnings": [
    "Wet clothing loses insulation value and causes cooling as moisture evaporates.",
    "Tight clothing and footwear restrict blood circulation and invite cold injury.",
    "The brain is very susceptible to cold and needs protection."
