    "Step 1: Urinate on white snow to check hydration status.",
    "Step 2: If urine makes snow dark yellow, you are becoming dehydrated and need fluids.",
    "Step 3: If urine makes snow light yellow to no color, fluid balance is normal.",
    "Step 4: Drink water regularly - need for water is as great in cold as warm environments.",
    "Step 5: Be aware that heavy clothing absorbs moisture you lose, masking dehydration."

  "warnings": [
    "Cold weather can mask dehydration symptoms.",
    "Exposure to cold increases urine output, further depleting body fluids.",
    "Bundled clothing absorbs evaporated moisture, making water loss less obvious."
