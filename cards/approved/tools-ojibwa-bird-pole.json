  ],
  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Cut a pole 1.8-2.1 meters long, removing all limbs and foliage (avoid resinous wood like pine).",
    "Step 2: Sharpen the upper end to a point and drill a small hole 5-7.5 cm from the top.",
    "Step 3: Cut a perch stick 10-15 cm long, shaping one end to almost fit in the hole.",
    "Step 4: Plant the pole in the ground with pointed end up, in open area near feeding/watering sites.",
    "Step 5: Tie a weight equal to target bird species weight to cordage, pass free end through hole.",
    "Step 6: Tie slip noose covering the perch, tie overhand knot in cordage, position perch against hole.",
    "Step 7: Adjust tension so overhand knot holds perch in position, spread noose over perch on both sides."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Weight must match bird species - too heavy will cut off bird's feet allowing escape.",
    "Place away from tall trees in relatively open areas for best results.",
    "Requires precise adjustment of weight and tension to function properly."
