  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Remove core lines from parachute suspension line, tie outer casing between two trees.",
    "Step 2: Attach multiple core lines to the casing using prusik knots or girth hitches, spacing them evenly.",
    "Step 3: Starting at one end, tie second and third core lines together with overhand knots.",
    "Step 4: Continue tying fourth to fifth, sixth to seventh, until reaching the end with single lines at each end.",
    "Step 5: Start second row with first core line, tie it to second, third to fourth, and continue the pattern.",
    "Step 6: Use a moveable guideline positioned opposite your working side to keep rows even and regulate mesh size.",
    "Step 7: Continue tying rows until net reaches desired width, thread suspension line along bottom for strength."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Requires significant time and patience to construct properly.",
    "Mesh size must match target fish species - too large and small fish escape, too small and net clogs.",
    "Keep consistent tension throughout construction for even mesh pattern."
