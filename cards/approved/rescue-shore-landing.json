  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select landing point carefully - avoid coral reefs, rocky cliffs, and strong currents.",
    "Step 2: Look for gaps in surf line and head for them, preferably on lee side of island.",
    "Step 3: Take down mast and keep clothes/shoes on to avoid cuts.",
    "Step 4: Trail sea anchor over stern using maximum line available.",
    "Step 5: Use oars/paddles and adjust sea anchor to keep strain on line and raft pointed toward shore.",
    "Step 6: In medium surf, have half crew face seaward, half shoreward - alternate rowing as waves approach.",
    "Step 7: Ride in on crest of large wave, paddle hard to beach as far as possible.",
    "Step 8: Do not jump out until raft has grounded, then quickly exit and beach it."

  "warnings": [
    "Do not land when sun is low and straight ahead - impairs vision.",
    "Against strong wind/heavy surf, raft needs maximum speed to avoid being turned broadside.",
    "Avoid meeting large wave at moment it breaks.",
    "If raft turns over in surf, grab hold and ride it in.",
    "Do not land at night if avoidable."
