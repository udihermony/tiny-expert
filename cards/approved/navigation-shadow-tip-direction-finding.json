  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find straight stick 1 meter long and level spot free of brush where stick casts clear shadow.",
    "Step 2: Place stick in ground and mark shadow tip with stone or twig - this mark is always west.",
    "Step 3: Wait 10-15 minutes until shadow tip moves a few centimeters and mark new position.",
    "Step 4: Draw straight line through the two marks to get east-west line.",
    "Step 5: Stand with first mark (west) to your left and second mark to your right - you are now facing north."

  "warnings": [
    "This method works everywhere on Earth regardless of hemisphere or season.",
    "Ensure stick is planted vertically for accurate shadow casting.",
    "Use level ground to avoid shadow distortion that could affect accuracy."
