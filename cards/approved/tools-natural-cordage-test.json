  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Pull on a length of the material to test its tensile strength.",
    "Step 2: Twist the material between your fingers and roll the fibers together.",
    "Step 3: If it withstands handling without snapping apart, proceed to next test.",
    "Step 4: Tie an overhand knot with the fibers.",
    "Step 5: Gently tighten the knot - if it doesn't break, the material is suitable for cordage."

  "warnings": [
    "Test materials thoroughly before depending on them for critical applications.",
    "Even suitable materials may have weak points - inspect the entire length.",
    "Different parts of the same plant may have different strength characteristics."
