  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Use old sea ice (rounded corners, bluish color) as it has lost salinity over time.",
    "Step 2: Melt ice rather than snow when possible - one cup ice yields more water than one cup snow.",
    "Step 3: Completely melt ice or snow before putting in mouth - prevents internal cold injury.",
    "Step 4: Start with small amount in container near fire, add more as it melts.",
    "Step 5: Use body heat method: place snow in water bag between clothing layers for slow melting on the move.",
    "Step 6: Keep melted water next to body to prevent refreezing.",
    "Step 7: Don't fill canteen completely - allow sloshing to prevent freezing."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Never try to melt ice or snow in your mouth - removes body heat and causes internal cold injuries.",
    "Don't waste fuel melting ice/snow when other drinkable water sources available.",
    "Avoid drinking lots of liquid before bed - reduces sleep and increases cold exposure."
