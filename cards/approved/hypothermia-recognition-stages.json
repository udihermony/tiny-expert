  "difficulty": "medium",

    "Step 1: Watch for initial shivering when core temperature drops to 35.5°C (96°F).",
    "Step 2: Monitor for uncontrollable shivering that interferes with self-care ability.",
    "Step 3: At 35-32°C (95-90°F), look for sluggish thinking, irrational reasoning, and false feelings of warmth.",
    "Step 4: At 32-30°C (90-86°F), expect muscle rigidity, unconsciousness, and barely detectable vital signs.",
    "Step 5: Recognize that core temperatures below 25°C (77°F) are almost always fatal."

  "warnings": [
    "Hypothermia can be caused by general exposure or sudden wetting from falling into water or fuel spills.",
    "False feelings of warmth are dangerous - victims may remove protective clothing.",
    "Death is almost certain if core temperature falls below 25°C (77°F)."
