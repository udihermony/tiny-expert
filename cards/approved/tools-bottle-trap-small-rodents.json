  ],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Dig a hole 30-45 cm deep that is wider at the bottom than at the top.",
    "Step 2: Make the top opening as small as possible while still allowing target animals to fall through.",
    "Step 3: Ensure the walls slope backward so animals cannot climb out once they fall in.",
    "Step 4: Place a piece of bark or wood over the hole as cover.",
    "Step 5: Support the cover 2.5-5 cm off the ground using small stones as props.",
    "Step 6: Position near areas where mice and voles are active."

  "warnings": [
    "Check trap with extreme caution - it makes an excellent hiding place for snakes.",
    "Backward-sloping walls are essential or animals will climb out easily.",
    "Cover must be stable enough not to collapse but light enough for animals to hide under."
