  ],
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select a long pole and place it against a tree in an area with heavy squirrel activity.",
    "Step 2: Install several wire nooses (5-6 cm diameter) along the top and sides of the pole.",
    "Step 3: Position nooses about 2.5 cm off the pole surface.",
    "Step 4: Place top and bottom nooses exactly 45 cm from the ends of the pole.",
    "Step 5: Ensure squirrels cannot get their feet on solid surface or they will chew through wire.",
    "Step 6: Deploy multiple poles in the area to increase catch numbers."

  "warnings": [
    "If squirrels can brace against solid surfaces, they will chew through the wire and escape.",
    "Initial caution period - squirrels will investigate before attempting to use the pole.",
    "Check trap regularly as struggling animals will eventually fall and strangle."
