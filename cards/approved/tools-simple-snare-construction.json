  ],
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Create a noose from wire (preferred) or strong cordage.",
    "Step 2: Position noose upright over a game trail or den hole entrance.",
    "Step 3: Use small twigs, grass blades, or spider web filaments to hold the noose open and in position.",
    "Step 4: Make the noose large enough for the animal's head to pass through freely.",
    "Step 5: Attach the other end of the snare line to a firmly planted stake.",
    "Step 6: Position at head height - never low enough for the animal to step into with a foot."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Wire is preferred over cordage as it won't loosen and allow escape.",
    "Noose must be sized correctly - too small won't let head through, too large won't tighten properly.",
    "This type of snare usually doesn't kill the animal immediately."
