  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find a stone with slight hourglass shape that allows secure lashing.",
    "Step 2: If no suitable stone exists, create groove by 'pecking' with smaller hard stone.",
    "Step 3: Select straight-grained hardwood handle of comfortable length for stone weight.",
    "Step 4: Choose lashing method: split handle, forked branch, or wrapped handle technique.",
    "Step 5: Secure stone tightly using strong cordage, plant fibers, or improvised rope.",
    "Step 6: Test balance and security of attachment before use."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Stone must be securely attached - loose head can injure user or break at critical moment.",
    "Balance the weight - too heavy makes club unwieldy, too light reduces effectiveness.",
    "Check lashing regularly for wear and retighten as needed."
