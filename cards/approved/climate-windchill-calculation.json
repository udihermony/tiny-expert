  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Measure or estimate current air temperature.",
    "Step 2: Measure or estimate wind speed in kilometers per hour.",
    "Step 3: Apply windchill calculation - example: -10°C with 27.8 kph (15 knot) wind equals -23°C windchill.",
    "Step 4: Remember you create wind by moving - skiing, running, or working around aircraft.",
    "Step 5: Plan activities considering windchill, not just air temperature.",
    "Step 6: Seek wind protection when possible to reduce effective temperature."

  "warnings": [
    "Windchill can make survivable temperatures deadly.",
    "Movement creates additional wind even in still air.",
    "Extremely hazardous conditions exist when wind and low temperature combine."
