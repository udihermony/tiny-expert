  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Never build fire too close to shelter - fires can burn underground and resurface nearby.",
    "Step 2: In snow shelters, control heat to avoid melting insulating snow layer.",
    "Step 3: Ensure adequate ventilation in any enclosed shelter with fire.",
    "Step 4: Position yourself to avoid scorching clothes while warming or drying gear.",
    "Step 5: Build windbreaks to prevent melting overhead snow from extinguishing fire.",
    "Step 6: Use small fires and stove combinations for cooking - more efficient fuel use."

  "warnings": [
    "Carbon monoxide poisoning can occur in poorly ventilated shelters with fires.",
    "Excessive heat in snow shelters melts insulation and camouflage.",
    "Underground fires can travel and emerge unexpectedly near shelters.",
    "Melting overhead snow can bury you, your equipment, and extinguish your fire."
