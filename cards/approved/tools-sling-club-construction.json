  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select a suitable handle of comfortable length and grip diameter.",
    "Step 2: Find or create a weight (stone, heavy wood knot, etc.).",
    "Step 3: Create strong, flexible lashing material 8-10 centimeters long.",
    "Step 4: Securely attach one end of lashing to the weight.",
    "Step 5: Attach other end of lashing to the end of the handle.",
    "Step 6: Test swing motion to ensure weight moves freely without tangling."

  "warnings": [
    "Practice swings away from your body and others to avoid accidental strikes.",
    "Ensure lashing is strong enough to hold weight during violent swinging motions.",
    "Flexible head increases striking force but requires more skill to control accurately."
