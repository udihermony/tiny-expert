    "Step 3: Take extra measures to prevent infection in all wounds.",
    "Step 4: Practice rigorous personal hygiene to prevent respiratory infections and colds.",
    "Step 5: Clean shelter site using a branch or disposable object to remove contaminated materials.",

  "warnings": [
    "Body will be extremely sensitive to infections due to radiation effects on blood chemistry.",
