  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Identify slopes that face different directions.",
    "Step 2: In Northern Hemisphere, observe that north-facing slopes are cooler and damper.",
    "Step 3: In summer, look for patches of snow remaining on north-facing slopes.",
    "Step 4: In winter, observe that south-facing slopes lose snow first and have shallower snowpack.",
    "Step 5: Note that vegetation is typically more lush on south-facing slopes in Northern Hemisphere."

  "warnings": [
    "Works opposite in Southern Hemisphere - south-facing slopes are cooler and damper.",
    "Local weather patterns and terrain can create exceptions to these rules.",
    "Most reliable when comparing multiple slopes in the same area."
