    "Step 1: Gather a convex lens from binoculars, camera, telescopic sight, or magnifying glass.",
    "Step 2: Prepare very dry, fine tinder in your fire lay.",
    "Step 3: Angle the lens to concentrate the sun's rays into a small, bright spot on the tinder.",
    "Step 4: Hold the lens steady over the same spot until the tinder begins to smoke and smolder.",
    "Step 5: Once smoldering starts, gently blow or fan the tinder to encourage flame.",
    "Step 6: Quickly apply the flaming tinder to your prepared fire lay."

  "warnings": [
    "Only works on bright, sunny days with direct sunlight.",
    "Do not look directly at the concentrated light beam as it can damage your eyes.",
    "Keep the focused beam steady - moving it around will prevent ignition.",
    "Have your fire lay completely prepared before attempting ignition."
