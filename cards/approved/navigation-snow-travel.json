  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Make improvised snowshoes using willow branches, strips of cloth, leather, or similar materials when snow is 30+ cm deep.",
    "Step 2: Avoid snow-covered streams as snow insulation may prevent ice formation over water.",
    "Step 3: In hilly terrain, avoid areas where avalanches appear possible.",
    "Step 4: Travel in early morning hours in avalanche-prone areas when snow is most stable.",
    "Step 5: On ridges, stay away from cornices (overhanging snow piles on lee side) that extend far from the ridge."

  "warnings": [
    "Do not travel in deep snow without snowshoes or skis - it's almost impossible and leaves obvious trails for pursuers.",
    "Never step on cornices - they can break loose and cause falls or avalanches.",
    "Avoid snow-covered streams as the water underneath may not be frozen."
