  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Remove feathers by plucking (preferred) or skinning - skinning removes some food value.",
    "Step 2: Open the body cavity and remove all entrails.",
    "Step 3: Save the craw (in seed-eating birds), heart, and liver for additional nutrition.",
    "Step 4: Cut off the feet at the joints.",
    "Step 5: For scavenger birds: boil for at least 20 minutes before other cooking to kill parasites."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Scavenger birds require extended boiling (20+ minutes) to kill parasites before final cooking.",
    "Plucking preserves more nutrition than skinning.",
    "Inspect saved organs for signs of disease before eating."
