  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: After skinning animal, remove all excess fat and meat pieces from the skin.",
    "Step 2: Dry the skin completely without stretching, ensuring no moisture-trapping folds.",
    "Step 3: Hair removal is not necessary for lashing purposes.",
    "Step 4: While skin is dry, cut strips about 6 millimeters wide.",
    "Step 5: Start from center of hide and make one continuous circular cut, working clockwise to outer edge.",
    "Step 6: Soak the rawhide strips for 2 to 4 hours until soft.",
    "Step 7: Use while wet, stretching as much as possible during application.",
    "Step 8: Allow to dry completely - it will shrink and become very strong."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Ensure skin is completely dry before cutting to prevent spoilage.",
    "Work quickly once soaked as rawhide becomes harder to work as it dries.",
    "Stretch rawhide to maximum during application for strongest bond when dry."
