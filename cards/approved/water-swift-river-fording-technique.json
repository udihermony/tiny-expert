  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Remove pants and shirt to reduce water's pull, but keep footgear on for protection and grip.",
    "Step 2: Tie clothing to top of rucksack so all items stay together if you must release equipment.",
    "Step 3: Carry pack high on shoulders and ensure you can remove it quickly if needed.",
    "Step 4: Find strong pole 7.5 centimeters diameter and 2.1-2.4 meters long.",
    "Step 5: Plant pole firmly on upstream side to break current, keeping it slanted so current holds it against your shoulder.",
    "Step 6: Move pole forward slightly downstream from previous position but still upstream from you.",
    "Step 7: Step forward placing foot below the pole position.",
    "Step 8: Cross at 45-degree angle to downstream current.",
    "Step 9: Repeat pole placement and stepping until across."

  "warnings": [
    "Pack weight helps stability - do not discard it unless absolutely necessary for safety.",
    "Ensure pack can be released quickly to prevent being dragged underwater.",
    "Keep pole angled properly so current assists rather than fights your balance."
