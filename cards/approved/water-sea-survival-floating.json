  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Float on your back for least energy - lie back, spread arms and legs, arch your back.",
    "Step 2: Control breathing in and out to keep face above water.",
    "Step 3: If rough seas prevent back floating, float face-down and lift head periodically to breathe.",
    "Step 4: Use dog paddle stroke when clothed or wearing life jacket - slow but requires little energy.",
    "Step 5: Use breaststroke for swimming underwater, through oil/debris, or in rough seas.",
    "Step 6: Use sidestroke as relief stroke - only one arm maintains momentum.",
    "Step 7: Use backstroke to relieve muscles used in other strokes."

  "warnings": [
    "A person who knows how to relax in ocean water is in very little danger of drowning due to natural buoyancy.",
    "Your head will be partially submerged when back floating, but your face will remain above water.",
    "You may sleep for short periods while back floating."
