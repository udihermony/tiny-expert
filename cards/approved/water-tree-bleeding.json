  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Identify suitable trees: palms (buri, coconut, sugar, rattan, nips), traveler's tree, umbrella tree, or baobab.",
    "Step 2: For palms: bruise a lower frond and pull it downward to create an injury.",
    "Step 3: Position a container to catch liquid that 'bleeds' from the injury site.",
    "Step 4: For traveler's tree: look for water collected in cuplike sheaths at leaf bases.",
    "Step 5: For baobab: look for clear water stored in the bottle-shaped trunk during dry seasons."

  "warnings": [
    "Positively identify the tree species before attempting - some trees may have toxic sap.",
    "Do not consume sap that is sticky, milky, or bitter.",
    "Baobab water may only be available for weeks after wet season, not year-round."
