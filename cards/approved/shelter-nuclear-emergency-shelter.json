  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find shelter within 5 minutes - speed is absolutely essential for survival.",
    "Step 2: Seek natural terrain like ditches, ravines, rocky outcroppings, hills, or river banks.",
    "Step 3: If no natural shelter exists, dig a fighting position or slit trench immediately.",
    "Step 4: Work from inside the trench as soon as it's large enough to cover part of your body.",
    "Step 5: Stack dirt carefully and evenly around the trench for additional shielding.",
    "Step 6: Dig deep enough for good protection, then enlarge for comfort later.",
    "Step 7: Cover with 1 meter or more of earth for maximum protection."

  "warnings": [
    "Without shelter, the dosage in the first few hours exceeds that of an entire week later.",
    "Do not build a roof unless materials are readily available - extended exposure is more dangerous.",
    "Keep all body parts covered with clothing while building to prevent beta burns."
