  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find a sharp-edged piece of stone, preferably chert or flint.",
    "Step 2: Make a chipping tool from wood, bone, or metal for breaking off small stone pieces.",
    "Step 3: Make a flaking tool from bone, antler tines, or soft iron for creating thin flakes.",
    "Step 4: Rough out the desired knife shape using the chipping tool, keeping it fairly thin.",
    "Step 5: Use the flaking tool along the entire edge, pressing against it to create flakes on the opposite side.",
    "Step 6: Continue flaking until you have a razor-sharp cutting edge.",
    "Step 7: Lash the blade to a suitable handle for safe use."

  "warnings": [
    "Stone knives are excellent for puncturing and chopping but won't hold a fine edge for long.",
    "Work carefully - stone flakes are extremely sharp and can cause serious cuts.",
    "Some stones like chert or flint can achieve very fine edges, others cannot."
