    "Step 1: Look for areas where waves rush up onto rocks, avoid places where waves explode with high white spray.",
    "Step 2: Stay fully clothed and keep shoes on to reduce injury from rocks.",
    "Step 3: Swim slowly on approach to conserve strength for holding onto rocks.",
    "Step 4: Advance behind a large wave into the breakers.",
    "Step 5: Face toward shore and take sitting position with feet in front, 60-90 centimeters (2-3 feet) lower than your head.",
    "Step 6: Let your feet absorb shock when you strike submerged rocks or reefs.",
    "Step 7: If you don't reach shore behind first wave, swim with hands only until next wave approaches.",
    "Step 8: Repeat sitting position with feet forward for each wave until you land."
