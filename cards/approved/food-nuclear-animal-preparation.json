  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Never eat animals that appear sick - they may have bacterial infections from radiation poisoning.",
    "Step 2: Carefully skin all animals to prevent radioactive particles from entering the body.",
    "Step 3: Cut meat away from bones, leaving at least 3mm thickness of meat on the bone.",
    "Step 4: Discard all internal organs (heart, liver, kidneys) as they concentrate radioactivity.",
    "Step 5: Cut meat into pieces less than 13mm thick before cooking.",
    "Step 6: Cook all meat until very well done to ensure safety.",
    "Step 7: Eggs are safe to eat even if laid during fallout period.",
    "Step 8: Avoid all milk from fallout area animals."

  "warnings": [
    "Animal skeletons contain over 90% of radioactivity - stay away from bones and joints.",
    "Fish and aquatic animals have much greater contamination - use only in extreme emergency.",
    "Contaminated meat can cause severe illness or death even if thoroughly cooked."
