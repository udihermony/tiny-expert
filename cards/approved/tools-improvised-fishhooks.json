  ],
  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Source materials: pins, needles, wire, small nails, metal pieces, wood, bone, thorns, or shells.",
    "Step 2: For wooden hooks: cut hardwood piece 2.5 cm long, 6 mm diameter for the shank.",
    "Step 3: Cut a notch in one end of the wooden shank to hold the point material.",
    "Step 4: Insert point material (bone, wire, nail) into the notch securely.",
    "Step 5: Tie the point firmly in place so it cannot move or fall out of position.",
    "Step 6: For smaller hooks, scale down all materials proportionally.",
    "Step 7: Alternative: make a gorge - sharp double-pointed stick notched in middle where line attaches."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Ensure point is secure - losing the point means losing the entire hook and potentially fish.",
    "Test hook strength before using with valuable bait or in critical fishing situations.",
    "Gorge hooks are swallowed completely and work by lodging crosswise in fish's throat."
