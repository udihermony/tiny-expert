  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Determine wind direction by dropping leaves/grass or watching treetops.",
    "Step 2: Watch for rapidly shifting winds which indicate unsettled atmosphere and likely weather changes.",
    "Step 3: Observe smoke - rising in thin vertical column indicates fair weather, low rising or flattened smoke indicates storms.",
    "Step 4: Watch birds and insects - they fly lower than normal in heavy, moisture-laden air before rain.",
    "Step 5: Note bee activity increases before fair weather, while most other insect activity increases before storms.",
    "Step 6: Recognize low-pressure fronts: slow/imperceptible winds, heavy humid air, more pronounced wilderness odors, sharper sounds that carry farther."

  "warnings": [
    "Low-pressure fronts promise bad weather that will likely linger for several days.",
    "Plan accordingly for extended poor weather when multiple indicators point to storms."
