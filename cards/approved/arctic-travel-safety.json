  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Never travel during blizzards or whiteout conditions - impossible to judge terrain.",
    "Step 2: Cross thin ice by lying flat and crawling to distribute weight.",
    "Step 3: Cross snow bridges at right angles, probe ahead with pole or ice axe for strength.",
    "Step 4: Cross streams when water level is lowest - levels can vary 2-2.5 meters daily.",
    "Step 5: Use snowshoes when snow is 30+ centimeters deep.",
    "Step 6: Travel in early morning in avalanche-prone areas.",
    "Step 7: Make camp early to allow time for proper shelter construction.",
    "Step 8: Be aware that clear arctic air makes distance estimation difficult - you usually underestimate."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Avoid snow-covered streams - snow insulates and may prevent ice formation over water.",
    "Avoid cornices (overhanging snow piles on lee side of ridges) - they can break if stepped on.",
    "Traveling on foot in deep snow without snowshoes/skis leaves obvious trail for pursuers.",
    "Some frozen rivers may have soft, open areas making travel difficult or impossible."
