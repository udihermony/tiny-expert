  ],
  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select a site with moist soil (dry stream bed or low area) that gets sunlight most of the day.",
    "Step 2: Dig a bowl-shaped hole 1 meter across and 60 centimeters deep.",
    "Step 3: Dig a sump in the center sized for your collection container.",
    "Step 4: Anchor tubing to the container bottom with a loose overhand knot.",
    "Step 5: Place container upright in the sump and extend tubing up and beyond the hole's lip.",
    "Step 6: Cover the hole with clear plastic sheet, securing edges with soil.",
    "Step 7: Place a rock in the center of the plastic to create an inverted cone 40 centimeters below ground.",
    "Step 8: Ensure the cone's apex is directly over the container and plastic doesn't touch hole sides.",
    "Step 9: Add more soil around plastic edges and plug the tube when not in use.",
    "Step 10: For polluted water purification, dig a trough 25 cm from the still's lip, 25 cm deep, 8 cm wide, and pour polluted water into it."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Plastic must not touch the hole sides or condensed water will be absorbed by earth.",
    "Do not spill polluted water around the rim where plastic touches soil.",
    "You need at least three stills to meet daily water intake needs.",
    "Takes about 24 hours to produce 0.5 to 1 liter of water."
