  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Recognize that clear arctic air makes objects appear closer than they actually are.",
    "Step 2: When estimating travel time or distance, assume your first estimate is too short.",
    "Step 3: Add 50-100% more time/distance to your initial estimates.",
    "Step 4: Use known reference objects to help calibrate distance judgments when possible."

    "Underestimating distances can lead to being caught in the open without shelter.",
    "Poor distance judgment can result in inadequate food/water planning for travel."
