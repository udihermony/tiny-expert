  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find a low spot or depression between dunes or rocks for your shelter location.",
    "Step 2: Dig a trench 45-60 centimeters deep, long and wide enough to lie in comfortably.",
    "Step 3: Pile sand from the trench to form a mound around three sides of the opening.",
    "Step 4: Dig out additional sand on the open end to create easy entrance/exit access.",
    "Step 5: Cover the trench with available material (poncho, canvas, parachute).",
    "Step 6: Secure covering material using sand, rocks, or other weights.",
    "Step 7: If extra material available, create second layer 30-45 centimeters above first cover for additional 11-22°C temperature reduction."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Build this shelter before the heat of day as physical effort increases dehydration.",
    "Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent suffocation.",
    "Double-layer construction significantly improves temperature reduction but requires more materials."
