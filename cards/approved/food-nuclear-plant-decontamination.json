  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Prioritize underground vegetables: potatoes, turnips, carrots - scrub and remove skins completely.",
    "Step 2: Second choice: fruits/vegetables you can wash and peel - bananas, apples, tomatoes.",
    "Step 3: Third choice: smooth-skinned plants that cannot be easily peeled.",
    "Step 4: Scrub all plant foods thoroughly - smooth surfaces lose 90% contamination when washed.",
    "Step 5: Avoid rough-surfaced plants like lettuce - washing removes only 50% contamination.",
    "Step 6: Avoid dried fruits and beans as last resort - difficult to decontaminate effectively.",
    "Step 7: Avoid growing plants if possible - they absorb radioactivity through leaves and roots."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Rough-surfaced plants cannot be effectively decontaminated and should only be eaten as last resort.",
    "Growing plants absorb radioactive materials through leaves and soil, especially after rain.",
    "The rougher the surface, the less effective washing becomes for decontamination."
