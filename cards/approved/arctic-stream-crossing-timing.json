    "Step 1: Observe the stream for several hours to identify the lowest water level period.",
    "Step 2: Cross during the lowest water level, which varies based on distance from glacier and temperature.",
    "Step 3: Account for water level variance of 2 to 2.5 meters per day when timing your crossing.",
    "Step 4: Plan your campsite location considering this daily water level fluctuation."

  "warnings": [
    "Water levels can change dramatically and unpredictably throughout the day.",
    "Being caught in rising water can trap you on the wrong side or sweep you away."
