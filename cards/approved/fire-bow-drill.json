  "difficulty": "hard",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Make a fire board: seasoned softwood, 2.5 cm thick, 10 cm wide, with a 2 cm depression near the edge and V-shaped notch underneath.",
    "Step 2: Create a drill: straight seasoned hardwood, 2 cm diameter, 25 cm long, with round top and blunt bottom.",
    "Step 3: Fashion a bow: resilient green stick 2.5 cm diameter with cordage tied from end to end without slack.",
    "Step 4: Find a socket: stone or hardwood with slight depression to hold drill and apply pressure.",
    "Step 5: Place tinder bundle under the V-shaped notch in the fire board.",
    "Step 6: Put one foot on fire board, loop bowstring over drill, place drill in depression.",
    "Step 7: Hold socket on top of drill with one hand, saw bow back and forth with other hand to spin drill.",
    "Step 8: Once smooth motion is established, apply more downward pressure and work bow faster.",
    "Step 9: Continue until hot black powder grinds into tinder and creates a spark.",
    "Step 10: Blow gently on tinder until it ignites into flame."

  "warnings": [
    "This method is exhaustive and requires significant practice to master.",
    "Do not use wood lying on the ground - it lacks sufficient friction properties.",
    "Ensure all materials are properly prepared before attempting.",
    "Stop immediately if drill begins to smoke excessively without producing ember."
