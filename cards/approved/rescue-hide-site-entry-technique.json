    "Step 2: Use a button hook technique - move past the hide site, then circle back from a different angle.",
    "Step 3: Stop at a position outside the hide site and conduct a listening halt for at least 2-3 minutes.",
    "Step 4: Move individually into the hide site, being careful not to disturb or cut any vegetation.",

  "warnings": [
    "Direct entry creates obvious trails leading to your position that trackers can follow.",
    "Any vegetation disturbance around the hide site will reveal your presence.",
    "Movement above 45cm can be spotted by observers from a distance."
