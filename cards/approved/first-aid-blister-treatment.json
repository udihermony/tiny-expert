  "steps": [
    "Step 1: For small blisters - do not open them. Leave intact blisters safe from infection.",
    "Step 2: Apply padding material around small blisters to relieve pressure and reduce friction.",
    "Step 3: For large blisters - obtain a clean sewing needle and sterilized thread.",
    "Step 4: Run the needle and thread completely through the large blister.",
    "Step 5: Remove needle but leave both ends of thread hanging out of the blister.",
    "Step 6: Allow thread to absorb liquid inside, reducing blister size while keeping hole open.",
    "Step 7: Pad around the treated blister to prevent further pressure.",
    "Step 8: If blister bursts naturally, treat as open wound with daily cleaning and dressing."

  "warnings": [
    "Never completely drain large blisters - this increases infection risk.",
    "If blister becomes red, swollen, or produces pus, it may be infected."
