  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Select a straight-grained piece of hardwood about 30cm long and 2.5cm in diameter.",
    "Step 2: Fashion a blade about 15cm long, shaving it down to a point.",
    "Step 3: Use only straight-grained portions, avoiding the core or pith.",
    "Step 4: Slowly dry the blade portion over a fire until lightly charred (the drier, the harder).",
    "Step 5: After charring, sharpen the point on a coarse stone.",
    "Step 6: For bamboo: remove inner wood to make blade thinner, keeping the hard outer layer intact."

  "warnings": [
    "Use only for puncturing - wood knives cannot hold a cutting edge.",
    "When charring bamboo, char only the inside wood, not the outside layer.",
    "Avoid resinous woods which will taint food and leave an aftertaste."
