  "difficulty": "medium",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Find a piece of ferrous metal that can be needle-shaped or a flat razor blade.",
    "Step 2: Magnetize the metal by slowly stroking it in one direction on silk or through hair using deliberate strokes.",
    "Step 3: Always stroke in the same direction only - never back and forth.",
    "Step 4: Suspend the magnetized metal from nonmetallic string or long hair, OR",
    "Step 5: Float it on a small piece of wood in still water.",
    "Step 6: The metal will align itself with the north-south line."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Metal must be ferrous (iron-containing) to be magnetized.",
    "Water must be still for floating method to work.",
    "String or hair must be nonmetallic to avoid interference."
