  "difficulty": "easy",
  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Cover all exposed skin including face, hands, neck, and ears.",
    "Step 2: Use darker colors on areas that stick out and catch light - forehead, nose, cheekbones, chin, ears.",
    "Step 3: Use lighter colors on recessed or shaded areas - around eyes and under chin.",
    "Step 4: Apply colors in irregular blotch or slash patterns, not geometric shapes.",
    "Step 5: Use camouflage paint, charcoal from burned wood, or mud as coloring agents.",
    "Step 6: Have buddy check completeness of camouflage application.",
    "Step 7: Reapply frequently as skin oils will wash off camouflage."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "Oily skin becomes shiny and attracts attention - wash and reapply camouflage regularly.",
    "Avoid regular geometric patterns that look artificial.",
    "Change camouflage colors as you move through different terrain types.",
    "Do not forget easily missed areas like ears and back of neck."
